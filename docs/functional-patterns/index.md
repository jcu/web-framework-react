Functional patterns are the tangible building blocks of the interface. Their
purpose is to enable or encourage certain user behaviours. The functional
patterns are based on business and user requirements.

> What are the behaviours we need to encourage at this stage of the user journey?
> What are the patterns that can support those behaviours?
> Where else on the site do they exist and how do they work there?
> If it’s a new pattern, how does it contribute to the whole system?

Examples of functional patterns include tabs, accordions, videos, event list,
slideshows, progress indicators, summary cards, testimonials and anything else
that makes up a part of the User Interface (UI) in an application.
